subtitle: "Due: Tuesday, December 5, 2017"
title: "CSC 170 Lab 17: Mobile Design"
---

The goal of this assignment is to make your lab website mobile friendly down to
*iPhone 6*-sized devices: **375 x 667px** using as any or all of the techniques
covered in the lecture on Tuesday, November 28.

Setup
=====

-   Make a copy of your **lab14** or **lab15** folder (depending on if you want
    to continue using PHP Includes) and call it **lab16**

-   In the HEAD of *each* HTML file, change the title in the \<title\> tag to
    "Lab 15 - …" [^1]  
    e.g. \<title\>**Lab 16** - Shakespeare\</title\>

    [^1]: If you're still using PHP includes, this is a snap!

Re-write Your Website CSS
=========================

Mobile friendly means: at small viewport widths…

-   No horizontal scroll bars

-   All elements fit their containers

-   Text is not too small to read comfortably, and there must be a lot of
    contrast between text color and its background

-   Images must still be recognizable for what they are, i.e. not too small

-   The navigation elements look like buttons and they are finger-sized (easily
    tap-able)

Other requirements:

-   You must use the META VIEWPORT tag to override *Apple Safari for iPhone*'s
    default viewport

-   You must code everything by hand

    -   For those of you familiar with CSS frameworks: you may NOT use any of
        them!  
        E.g. Bootstrap, Materialize, et cetera …not allowed.

Check and Upload your Work
==========================

When you are done with your webpage, close everything and use an FTP tool to
access your account on **urcsc170.org** and upload your files:

-   In a web browser (any), go to this address to check your handiwork:  
    **www.urcsc170.org/accountname/lab16**  
    (where “*accountname*” is your account name)

Report your work
================

-   In our Blackboard section, in Lab 16, post a link to your webpage to receive
    credit for this Lab.
