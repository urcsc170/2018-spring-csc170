# Lab 3: Content Preparation
*Due: Wednesday, January 31, 2018 at 9:00 AM (before the next lab comes out)*

For this assignment, you need to gather content and prepare it for the web. You
will copy content from Wikipedia (*not* Shakespeare!) and fulfill the
requirements as described in this document.

Note: There is nothing technical about this lab assignment. You simply must have
good content that you will use for the following lab assignments.

## 1. Gather Text Content

Go to Wikipedia and find a topic that interests you and has enough content for
this assignment. Collect enough content in plain text, images and links.

-   Create a Word Document named **lab03-yourname.docx** (where *yourname* is
    your name).

-   In it, copy and paste enough content to create *at least* these following
    elements

-   A title (this will act as a first level heading)

-   A subtitle<br>*Most Wikipedia pages don't have subtitles. You can just make one up.*

-   At least four second level headings

-   At least three paragraphs of text associated with each of the first three
    second level headings

-   At least two lists: unordered, ordered or definition list (any combination); they must appear under the last second level heading

-   At least three references and/or external links with their complete text and
    hypertext-links to other sources<br>*Copy & paste the URLs right in the text next to each citation*

-   One more citation, referring to the source of the Wikipedia page(s) you used
    in this assignment

Note: you can slop together any related content as you need to make the
assignment whole which includes: taking content from more than one Wikipedia page; writing a little bit of content yourself (for simple headers or captions, as needed). The assignment requires "real" content, but will not be graded for quality.

Look at the EXAMPLE document attached to this lab assignment in Blackboard. When youâ€™re done, you should have a document that kinda looks like that but with different content.

## 2. Gather and Prepare Images

Also required with your submission of the Word document, you need to provide at
least two image files (usually JPGs).

-   IMPORTANT: do *not* embed the image files in the Word document - keep them
    as separate files.

-   Download at least two images from your Wikipedia page(s)

    -   The images must be smaller than about 250px wide

    -   Most likely, the images will be larger than 250px. If so you must use
        image editing software to make it so resize them<br>*Just about any photo editing software will do. You can use Photoshop which is installed on the University computers but that'd be overkill. On Windows machines, try Paint. On Macs, try Preview.*

## 3: Upload your work

When you've gathered your text content in a Word document and prepared at least
two image files upload them to the Lab 3 Lab Assignment in Blackboard

Note: Upload the files to Blackboard separately. Do not ZIP/compress them, and
especially do *not* embed the images in the Word document.
