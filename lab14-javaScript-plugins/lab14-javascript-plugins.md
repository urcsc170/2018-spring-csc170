# CSC 170 Lab 14: JavaScript Plugins
Due: Thursday, November 16, 2017

The goal of this lab assignment is to rip-out the simple JavaScript solutions you used on the homepage of your website and replace them with more elegant, jQuery-powered plugins.

You will need to be familiar with these two plugins:

- Super Simple Slider ([supersimpleslider.com](http://supersimpleslider.com))
- jQuery UI ([jqueryui.com](http://jqueryui.com))


## Setup

- [ ]	Make a copy of your **lab13** folder.  Call it **lab14**

- [ ]	In the HEAD of each HTML file, change the title in the HEAD  to "Lab 14 - ..."  e.g.  `<title>Lab 14 - Shakespeare</title>`  (If you're still using PHP includes, this is a snap.)

- [ ]	Rip out the "hover trick" JavaScript you used from Lab 13]

	- Take the IMG element out of its FIGURE element - delete the FIGURE and FIGCAPTION elements.  Just leave the IMG under the "Welcome..." H2, by itself.
	- Remove the *onmouseover=""* and *onmouseout=""* attributes from the IMG
	- Create a second IMG element, right under the first, that points to your other image.  (The one you used for your *onmouseover*.)

- [ ]	Rip out the "More..." JavaScript you used from Lab 13
	-	Remove the IDs you used to toggle the content
	-	Delete the BUTTON element between your two DIVs
	-	Delete the DIVs around your content (leave the content)
	-	In the file system, delete the folder and file: **js/scripts.js**
	-	In the index file, delete the script link to the **js/scripts.js** file

You'll end up with something that looks like this:

## Install Super Simple Slider
You need to install the plugin according to the instructions by the author.  In all, you need to do the following:
- [ ]	Add the **sss** folder as-is to your **lab14** folder (Obtain the SSS folder from the author's website)

- [ ]	In your **index** file, in the correct location add a link to the **sss/sss.css** file
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="sss/sss.css">`

- [ ]	In your **index** file wrap your IMGs in a new DIV with a `class="slider"`

- [ ]	In your **index** file, in the correct location install jQuery
`<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>`

- [ ]	In your **index** file, in the correct location install the SSS plugin `<script src="sss/sss.min.js"></script>`

- [ ]	In your **index** file, in the correct location install an initialization string for the SSS plugin

	```html
	<script>
	$('.slider').sss();
	</script>
	```

## Install jQuery UI's Accordion Plugin
You need to install the plugin according to the instructions by the developers of jQuery UI.  In all, you need to do the following:

- [ ]	NOTE: you must *not* re-install jQuery!  (You already installed it when you added SSS.)
- [ ]	In your **index** file, in the correct location install the plugin script using a CDN that hosts the jQuery UI script

	```html
	<script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.js"></script>
	```

- [ ]	In your **index** file, in the correct location install an initialization string for the jQuery UI plugin

	```html
	<script>
	$( "#accordion" ).accordion({
		heightStyle: "content"
	});
	</script>
	```

- [ ]	Install the CSS using the CDN that hosts the jQuery UI styles
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css">

- [ ]	Wrap your content (a couple of headers and some paragraphs) in a new DIV with an `id="accordion"`

You should end up with something that looks like this:
![section of HTML](documentation-images/code-snippet2.png "something that looks like this")
 
OPTIONALLY: go into your hero.css file and change/add styles as you see fit to make the "hero" look nicer.  E.g. add `gird-gap: 25px;` to the `.hero` styles.  Maybe get rid of the border bottom?  It's up to you.

## Check and Upload your Work
- [ ]	Validate the HTML file ([http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/))

When you are done with your webpage, close everything and use an FTP tool (to access your account on **urcsc170.org** and upload your files:

- [ ]	In a web browser (any), go to this address to check your handiwork: 
	```www.urcsc170.org/accountname/lab14/index.html```<br>
	(where *accountname* is your account name)

## Report your work
â€¢	In our Blackboard section, in **Lab 14**, post a link to your webpage to receive credit for this Lab.
