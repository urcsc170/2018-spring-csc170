|Activity				| Weight of the final grade|
|---				|---	|
|**Lab Assignments**<br>There is lab work usually every week at the discretion of the instructor.  Each lab counts equally toward the total of 30%.  There will be approximately 16 lab assignments depending on current changes in the web development industry and the need to introduce (or remove) information and techniques into the course. <br>NOTE: each lab depends on the success of the previous so students need to keep-up and not skip labs.| **30%**<br>Each lab assignment will be worth about 2% of the overall grade|
|**Projects**<br>There are three projects during the semester. Each project depends on the success of the previous.|**40%**<br>Project 1: 10% <br>Project 2: 15%<br>Project 3: 15% |
|**Exams**<br>There will be two exams: a midterm and a final. The final exam is not comprehensive, but given the nature of the topic it is important to know the course material from the first half of the semester.<br>NOTE: the Final Exam is administered in the labs during the regular semester (not during exam week).  See [the course schedule](schedule.md) for exact exam dates and locations.|**30%**<br>Midterm exam: 15%<br>Final exam: 15%|

## Lab and Project Assignments
**Assignments** are made available via Blackboard after most lectures and can be completed in the lab room or independently on one's own Internet-connected computer (Mac or PC).  However...

**Help:** THIS IS IMPORTANT --> to get help on any lab assignment or project, students must go to the lab to which they are registered and find one of the TAs and ask them for help.

**Note:** throughout the semester, the assignments build on each other, meaning: students cannot complete one without successfully finishing the previous.  So, success in this course requires students to turn-in assignments on-time and in the right order.

### Due Dates
For each assignment and project, the **due date** is shown on page 1 near the top. To avoid a zero grade, each must be turned-in via Blackboard on or before its due date.  

### Late assignments
Late assignments will not be graded unless a prior arrangement has been made with the student's assigned TA to give them an **extension by one or two days**.  Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of the student's assigned TA. 

The grade for assignments not turned-in on time with no prior arrangement for an extension will be zero.

### Second chances
Mistakes on assignments may be fixed and re-graded for full credit if: The assignment was turned-in via Blackboard **on or before its due date** only.

If an assignment qualifies for a second chance, the student must fix the errors and resubmit the assignment in Blackboard **within two days** after the TA graded the assignment the first time.

## Texts and Materials
Because of the dynamic nature of the web development industry, this course does not use a textbook. All information required to pass the course comes from the lectures so attendance is mandatory.  

**Important:** Because attendence is not graded the student is on thier honor to go to all the lectures.  If a student is unable to attend a lecture, it is the student's responsibility to get the information missed from another student. (The TAs and the Professor will not re-teach a lecture.) 

Students' inability to answer exam questions, complete lab assignments, or complete projects because of a missed lecture is not a valid excuse.

### Personal Computer and Software
In addition to the hosted Web service, provided by the University, students will need to use a personal computer (PC or Mac) with specific capabilities and software installed:

- A code editor …not Notepad (PC) nor TextEdit (Mac)
- FTP software …a free one is okay
- An updated, popular web browser
- An Internet connection

If a student does not have a personal computer with these capabilities, the University provides open labs at various locations on campus that they can use.  Those computers have all the required capabilities and software installed and they are supported by University IT.  

For reference: during lectures the professor will be using a **Macbook** and **Windows PC** (alternatively) and a code editor: **Sublime Text, version 3** ([www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)). For FTP demonstrations, the professor will use **Cyberduck** (Mac) and **WinSCP** (PC).  

## Academic Honesty
Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person’s work as one’s own, or the attempt “to blur the line between one’s own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source.” ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, January 2003,](http://wpacouncil.org/node/9)). More specifically for CSC 170, **computer code (HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript) submitted for grading, that was copied from another source in part or whole without acknowledgment is plagiarism**.  To protect yourself, in the programming world, citations of sources may be placed in the "code comments" of submitted files.

### Industry Practices
Note that in the web development industry it is common for professional developers to inspect, i.e. look and study someone else's code for the purposes of inspiration.  In fact, that's how good developers get better, and in the industry, it's encouraged.  But here in academia there is a line between inspection for inspiration versus plagiarism.  Students must be very careful to not copy other students' code and submit it as their own without proper attribution.  In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University’s rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty.  For the complete College honesty policy, see: [www.rochester.edu/college/honesty](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty)

## Academic Assistance and Accommodations
Please know that this classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds and abilities. Students are invited to talk with the professor about any concern or situation that affects their ability to complete their academic work successfully. Useful resources for all students include the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, located at **1-154 Dewey Hall** on the River Campus; telephone: **(585) 275-9049** or email <cetl@rochester.edu>

## Schedule
This [schedule (linked here)](schedule.md) is subject to modification throughout the semester.  Always check with the professor to answer questions about the schedule.
