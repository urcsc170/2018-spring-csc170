|Activity				| Weight of the final grade|
|---				|---	|
|**Lab Assignments**<br>There is lab work usually every week at the discretion of the instructor.  Each lab counts equally toward the total of 30%.  There will be 16 lab assignments. Each lab depends on the success of the previous.| **30%**<br>Each lab assignment will be worth about 2% of the overall grade|
|**Projects**<br>There are three projects during the semester. Each project depends on the success of the previous.|**40%**<br>Project 1: 10% <br>Project 2: 15%<br>Project 3: 15% |
|**Exams**<br>There will be two exams: a midterm and a final. The final exam is not comprehensive, but given the nature of the topic, it will be important to know the course material from the first half of the semester.|**30%**<br>Midterm exam: 15%<br>Final exam: 15%|

## Lab and Project Assignments
**Assignments** are made available via Blackboard after most lectures and can be completed in the lab room, or independently on one's own Internet-connected computer (Mac or PC).  

**Help:** to get help on any lab assignment or project, you must go to the lab to which you are registered and find one of the TAs and ask them for help.

**Note:** throughout the semester, the assignments build on each other, meaning: you can't complete one without successfully finishing the previous.  So, success in this course requires you to turn-in assignments on-time and in the right order.

### Due Dates
For each assignment and project, the **due date** is shown on page 1 near the top. To avoid a zero grade, each must be turned-in via Blackboard on or before its due date.  

### Late assignments
Late assignments will not be graded unless a prior arrangement has been made with your assigned TA to give you an **extension by one or two days**.  Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of your assigned TA. 

The grade for assignments not turned-in on time with no prior arrangement for an extension will be zero.

### Second chances
Mistakes on assignments may be fixed and re-graded for full credit if: The assignment was turned-in via Blackboard **on or before its due date**.


If your assignment qualifies for a second chance, you must fix the errors and resubmit the assignment in Blackboard **within two days** after the TA graded the assignment the first time.

## Texts and Materials
Because of the dynamic nature of the web development industry, this course does not use a textbook. All information required to pass the course comes from the lectures.

### Personal Computer and Software
In addition to the hosted Web service (provided by the University), students will need to use a personal computer (PC or Mac) with specific capabilities and software installed:

- A code editor …not Notepad (PC) nor TextEdit (Mac)
- FTP software …a free one is okay
- An updated, popular web browser
- An Internet connection

If you do not have a personal computer with these capabilities, the University provides open labs at various locations on campus that students can use.  Those computers have all the required capabilities and software installed and they are supported by University IT.  

For your reference: during lectures the professor will be using a **Macbook** and **Windows PC** (alternatively) and a code editor: **Sublime Text, version 3** ([www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)). For FTP demonstrations, the professor will use **Cyberduck** (Mac) and **WinSCP** (PC).  

## Academic Honesty
Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person’s work as one’s own, or the attempt “to blur the line between one’s own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source.” ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, January 2003,](http://wpacouncil.org/node/9)). More specifically for CSC 170, **computer code (HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript) submitted for grading, that was copied from another source in part or whole without acknowledgment is plagiarism**.  To protect yourself, in the programming world, citations of sources may be placed in the "code comments" of submitted files.

### Industry Practices
Note that in the web development industry it is common for professional developers to inspect, i.e. look and study someone else's code for the purposes of inspiration.  In fact, that's how good developers get better, and in the industry, it's encouraged.  But here in academia there is a line between inspection for inspiration versus plagiarism.  You must be very careful to not copy other students' code and submit it as your own without proper attribution.  In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University’s rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty.

## Academic Assistance and Accommodations
Please know that this classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds and abilities. Students are invited to talk with the professor about any concern or situation that affects their ability to complete their academic work successfully. Useful resources for all students include the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, located at **1-154 Dewey Hall** on the River Campus; telephone: **(585) 275-9049** or email <cetl@rochester.edu>
