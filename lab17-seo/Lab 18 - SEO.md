Part I: Google Analytics
========================

Step 1: Login to Google Analytics
---------------------------------

-   Go to **www.google.com/analytics**

-   If you have to create an account, then do so. Else Sign in and/or enter
    Google Analytics using your Google-registered email address. (Your UR email
    is a Google-registered email address.)

Step 2: Sign up
---------------

-   Assuming you've never used Google Analytics before, you'll see the **Sign
    up** button. Click it.

Here you will create an account that points to your CSC 170 **Project 2
webpage** that you've installed on the webserver. To prepare for this step, in
another browser window, open your Project 2 webpage and copy the URL to your
clipboard.

-   On the New Account page in Google Analytics, scroll down to the "Setting up
    your account" section and enter an **Account Name**.  
    Use: *yourname*  
    (which of course, should be your name)

-   In the "Setting up your property" section, enter a **Website Name**. Use:  
    **Your Project 2 topic**  
    …where *your project 2 topic* is whatever your project 2 is about.

-   Enter (paste) into the **Website URL** field, the full web address of your
    Project 2

-   Change the **Reporting Time Zone** to **(GMT-05:00) Eastern Time**

-   Leave all other settings as-is, scroll down and click the **Get Tracking
    ID** button.

-   Accept the Terms and Conditions

Step 3: Get and Insert the Tracking Code your Project 2
-------------------------------------------------------

Here you will copy the tracking code from Google Analytics and paste it into the
HTML code of your Project 2. Be prepared to edit your Project 2 index.html file.

-   Copy the **Tracking Code** to your computer's clipboard.[^1]

    [^1]: The “tracking code” is that entire JavaScript snippet, *including* the
    opening and closing \<script\> tags – not just the UA number.

-   Open your Project 2 index.html file in a text editor.

-   Paste the tracking code into the bottom of your HTML, just *above* the
    closing \</body\> tag.

-   Save the file and re-upload it to the web server.

Step 4: Browse your Account
---------------------------

-   Click the REPORTING link in the top navigation bar

Data will start coming-in to your account immediately or soon. (Visit your own
Project 2 from time to time over the next day to make sure there's some data for
Google to record.)

Part II: Google Webmaster Tools
===============================

Step 1: Login to Google Webmaster tools
---------------------------------------

-   Go to **www.google.com/webmaster/tools**

>   Using the same credentials of your Google-registered email address (from
>   Part I), login to Google Webmaster tools.

Step 2: Get the URL of your Project 2
-------------------------------------

You must make sure you get the right URL, so follow these steps…

-   Open another browser window or tab, and go to your Project 2 on the web
    server

-   When you see your Project 2, copy the web address to your computer's
    clipboard.

Step 3: Add Project 2 to Google Webmaster Tools
-----------------------------------------------

-   Toggle back to Google Webmaster Tools and click the **ADD A PROPERTY**
    button. Paste the URL from your Project 2 into the text field and then click
    **Add**

-   Assuming you've successfully added a tracking code to your Project 2
    index.html file, when you get to the Verify page, simply click the
    **VERIFY** button, then click **Continue** on the confirmation page.

Step 4: Create a Sitemap
------------------------

-   Leaving the web page pointed to Google Webmaster Tools open, start another
    browser window or tab, and go to: **www.xml-sitemaps.com**

-   Paste the web address of your Project 2 in the **Your Website URL** box.

-   Scroll down to the **Start** button and click it

-   Click the **VIEW SITEMAP DETAILS** button and then the **DOWNLOAD YOUR XML
    SITEMAP FILE** button

-   Depending on the web browser you're using, the file (your sitemap) will
    download to your computer. (Take note of where it's downloading – you'll
    need to retrieve it.)

Step 5: Upload your Sitemap
---------------------------

-   Open an FTP tool and login to your account on the web server

-   Navigate to your Project 2 files

-   Upload the **sitemap.xml** file you created in Step 4 to the "webroot" (the
    folder named **project2**) on the web server

Step 6: Register your Sitemap
-----------------------------

-   Go back to the Site Dashboard in Google Webmaster Tools

-   Click the **Sitemaps** bar (the third column)

-   On the Sitemaps page, click the button: **ADD/TEST SITEMAP**

-   In the pop-up, type-in **sitemap.xml**

-   Click the **Submit Sitemap** button

-   Refresh the webpage you're looking at

If you received no error messages, you're done. Google will do the rest.

Step 7: Report your work
------------------------

To receive credit for this lab:

-   In our Blackboard section, in the Lab 17 assignment, (re)post a link to your
    **Project 2** webpage.
